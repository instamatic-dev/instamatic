## Getting started with development

### Setup

Clone the repository into the `instamatic` directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic
```

Install using `virtualenv`:

```console
cd instamatic
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e .[develop]
```

Alternatively, install using Conda:

```console
cd instamatic
conda create -n instamatic python=3.11
conda activate instamatic
pip install -e .[develop]
```

### Running tests

instamatic uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run the tests. You can run the tests for yourself using:

```console
pytest
```

To check coverage:

```console
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report  # to output to terminal
coverage html    # to generate html report
```


### Building the documentation

The documentation is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the pages.

To build the documentation for yourself:

```console
pip install -e .[docs]
mkdocs serve
```

You can find the documentation source in the [docs](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic/tree/main/docs) directory.
If you are adding new pages, make sure to update the listing in the [`mkdocs.yml`](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) under the `nav` entry.

### Making a release

1. Make a new [release](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic/releases).

2. Under 'Choose a tag', set the tag to the new version. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/), so bump the version (*major*/*minor*/*patch*) as needed. Bumping the version is handled transparently by `bumpversion` in [this workflow](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml).

3. The [upload to pypi](https://pypi.org/project/instamatic) is triggered when a release is published and handled by [this workflow](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic/actions/workflows/publish.yaml).

4. The [upload to zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5175957) is triggered when a release is published.
