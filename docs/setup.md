# Setting up Instamatic

Download the latest zip package from the [releases page](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic/releases). This installation is fully portable, and can be copied directly to the microscope computer.

## JEOL

If you are using a JEOL TEM, make sure `instamatic` is installed on a computer with the TEMCOM interface. This is usually already installed on the camera PC. It can also be installed on the microscope control PC.

## FEI

For FEI microscopes, `instamatic` must be installed on the microscope control PC. Alternatively, it can be installed on both the microscope PC and the camera PC, running `instamatic.temserver` on the microscope PC, and establishing a connection over the local network. See the config documentation for how to set this up.

## Development version

The latest, bleeding edge development version of `instamatic` is available from [here](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic/archive/main.zip).

If you run the portable installation, just extract and replace the `instamatic` directory in the root directory of the installation (the one that contains `start_Cmder.exe`). Make sure to delete the old one before.

If you want to install `instamatic` into your own python installation, just extract and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Setting up the config files

Normally `instamatic` is not very fussy about starting up, but it may complain if you try to run some commands where it is missing some information from the config.

The easiest way to get started is to run:
```bash
instamatic.autoconfig.exe
```
To help generate some of the input files (in particular templates for the microscope/calibration files). This should give you a working setup for the microscope.

In order of priority:

1. __Initialize the config directory__  
   If you are running the portable installation, you can skip this step. Otherwise, if you are running instamatic for the first time, it will set up the config directory. Simply run `instamatic`. It should say that it sets up the config directory and tell the path where the data are.

2. __Set up the microscope interface__  
   In `config/settings.yaml` define the camera interface you want to use. You can use the autoconfig tool or one of the example files and modify those. You can name these files anything you want, as long as the name under `microscope` matches the filename in `config/microscope`

3. __Set up the magnifications and camera lengths__  
   In the config file, i.e `config/microscope/jeol.yaml`, set the correct camera lengths (`range_diff`) and magnifications for your microscopes (`range_lowmag` and `range_mag1`). Also make sure you set the wavelength. Again, the autoconfig tool is your best friend, otherwise, the way to get those numbers is to simply write them down as you turn the magnification knob on the microcope.

4. __Set up the camera interface__  
   Specify the file you want to use for the camera interface, i.e. `camera: timepix` points to `config/camera/timepix.yaml`. In this file, make sure that the interface is set to your camera type and update the numbers as specified in the config documentation. If you do not want to set up the camera interface at this moment, you can use `camera: simulate` to fake the camera connection.

5. __Make the calibration table__  
   For each of the magnfications defined in `config/microscope/jeol.yaml`, specify the pixel sizes in the file defined by `calibration: jeol`, corresponding to the file `calibration/jeol.yaml`. For starters, you can simply set the calibration values to 1.0.

6. __Test if it works__  
   Run `instamatic.temcontroller` to start a IPython shell that initializes the connection. It should run with no crashes or warnings.

7. __Update `settings.yaml`__  
   There are a few more choices to make in `instamatic/settings.yaml`. If you use a TVIPS camera, make sure you put `use_cam_server: true`.

It is often a good idea to run the camserver and temserver in a different terminal window by running `instamatic.temserver` / `instamatic.camserver` if you specified this in `settings.yaml`.

- `config`: Contains all the config files for instamatic
- `instamatic`: Source code for `instamatic`. Replace this directory if you want to update `instamatic`.
- `logs`: Log files from `instamatic` are stored here.
