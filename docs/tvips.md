## cRED data collection with TVIPS

Module: `cred_tvips`

This module can be used for cRED/SerialRED data collection using a TVIPS camera. It can be enabled by adding the `cred_tvips` module to the `modules` section in the [settings](config.md).

`Instamatic` communicates with EMMENU to start and stop image acquisition. EMMENU must be running before `instamatic` is started. In EMMENU the correct camera profile should be selected (one with shutterless acquisition) before data collection is started. A navigator (`.nav`) file can be given to enable serial data collection on a large number of crystals.

Data are stored to the directory specified in the *Data i/o* dialog. Each new experiment is saved to a new directory, and previous data are never overwritten. Images are stored in `.tiff` format and experimental metadata are to `cRED_log.txt`

The python script [process_tvips.py](../scripts/process_tvips.py) can be used to convert the data to MRC or SMV format, with input files for [REDp](https://zenodo.org/record/2545322) (.ed3d) and [XDS](http://xds.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/) (XDS.INP).

Data collection was tested and developed on a JEOL 1400 with F416 camera.

#### 1. Console window

Shows the program output, see: [Console](gui.md#console).

#### 2. Input/output

Contronls where the data are stored. For more information, see: [Data i/o](gui.md#Data-io).


#### 3. Experimental parameters

**Target angle**  
The angle the goniometer should rotate to starting from the current angle. Pressing **invert** willl invert the angle (*i.e.* 40° to -40°).

If you check **Manual rotation control**, the target angle will be blanked and instead the rotation is controlled manually (*e.g.* via the panel or foot controls). `Instamatic` will then automatically terminate the experiment once it notices that rotation has stopped.

**Diff defocus**  
This is the defocus value to apply to the diffraction focus. This is used to quickly toggle to a *view* of the crystal without toggling the mode, which may introduce not refocus to the same position because of lens hysteresis. Check the **Toggle diff defocus** box to toggle between the focused/defocused mode. Pressing **Reset** will return to the original value.

**Exposure**  
The exposure time for each frame in milliseconds. Ideally, this should be set so that a single frame covers ~0.2-0.3°, but the added overhead from the camera should also be taken into account.

**Mode**  
Select the mode to collect data in, *e.g.* to do continuous real space tomography.

#### 4. Start/stop the experiment

These are the controls to collect a cRED data set from a single particle. To prepare the TEM for acquisition, press **Get Ready**. This will move to the right angle, turn off the beam blank, start the live view in EMMENU, etc. There will be a message once the TEM is ready.

Press **Acquire** to start the acquisition. The TEM will rotate to the specified angle, and automatically stop once finished. Pressing **Finalize** will unlock the interface so a new experiment can be started.

#### 5. Start serial acquisition

This button starts a serial acquisition using the instruction file given below. Once started, it can only be interrupted by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal.

The instruction file must be a `.nav` file compatible with [SerialEM](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/).

Data will be collected at every position with the `Acquire` flag set.

#### 6. Other controls

**Toggle DIFF**  
Toggles between diffraction (DIFF) and mag (MAG1) mode.

**Toggle screen**  
Moves the fluorescent screen up/down.

**Toggle beamblank**  
Toggle the beam blank. If the beam is blanked when the experiment is started, it will automatically unblank and re-blank afterwards.

**Start live view**  
Start the live view in EMMENU.

**Stop live view**  
Stop the live view in EMMENU.

**Search**  
Switch the microscope to search mode. Internally, these are defined as [`instamatic` scripts](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/instamatic/tree/main/instamatic/config/scripts) and can therefore be easily modified. The parameters of the search mode are defined in `$instamatic\scripts\search_mode.py`, for example to put the screen down, unblank the beam, and switch to MAG1 mode:

```python
ctrl.screen.down()
ctrl.beam.unblank()
ctrl.mode.set('mag1')
```

**Focus**  
Switch the microscope to focus mode. The parameters of the search mode are defined in `$instamatic\scripts\focus_mode.py`, for example to put the screen up, blank the beam, and switch to DIFF mode:

```python
ctrl.screen.up()
ctrl.beam.blank()
ctrl.mode.set('diff')
```

**Get Image**  
Acquire and store a single image. It will be available in the EMMENU image buffer.
